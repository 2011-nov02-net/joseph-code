    has default return behaviour?
    may be modified for specific output/rules.

.NET   (refer to dot-net-intro.txt)
    Common Language Infrastructure (CLI):
        .dll is an intermediate language (assembly) file
        each project is built (uses Roslyn compiler) into a .dll file
        Common Language Runtime (CLR) is a virtual machine which uses the JIT compiler to create executable local instructions
        JIT compiler is used to generate native instructions for local CPU from .dll file
    .NET Core 
        a redesign of .NET Framework, more flexible to use 
        Mono was another .NET framework, reverse engineered from Framework meant to run on UNIX (crosss platform)
        .NET standard is common between all frameworks based on .NET, it includes base libraries
            projects may be compiled using resources within .NET standard so that it will be usable between and .NET based framework
            csproj file <TargetFramework> property sets the framework tergeted for the project
        .NET Framework will be deprecated soon (next week)
        .NET Core will be renamed to simply .NET (5.0)

VS Studio
    .NEt Core console app
    default project location may be changed to c/Revature directory
    uncheck place solution and property in same directory
    use different name for solution (same name without .suffix)

Workspace Specifics
    solution
        project
            class
                members
    a solution is a bag of projects, to indicate that they should be "looked at" together (a list of pointers to projects)
    solutions are not used in VS code but are necessary in VS


    *look at shortcuts for generating properties (prop /t/t, propfull etc.)
    *look at what happens when an exception is thrown
